☕ Café Management System
📌 Project Overview

The Café Management System is a console-based application developed in C programming language using the Doubly Linked List data structure.

The system manages café operations such as inserting new dishes, placing orders, displaying menu items, and handling billing efficiently using dynamic memory allocation.

🎯 Objectives

Implement core Data Structures (Doubly Linked List) concepts

Simulate real-time café order processing

Practice dynamic memory management in C

Develop a modular and structured console application

🛠️ Technologies Used

C Programming Language

Doubly Linked List

Dynamic Memory Allocation

Standard C Libraries (stdio.h, stdlib.h, string.h)

⚙️ Features

➕ Add new dishes to the menu

🗑️ Delete dishes from the menu

✏️ Update existing menu items

📋 Display full menu

🛒 Place customer orders

🧾 Generate billing details

🔄 Traverse forward and backward using doubly linked list

🧠 Data Structure Used
Doubly Linked List

Each node contains:

Dish ID

Dish Name

Price

Pointers to next and previous node

This allows:

Efficient insertion and deletion

Bidirectional traversal

Dynamic memory usage

▶️ How to Run

git clone https://github.com/your-username/cafe-management-system.git


Navigate to project directory:

cd cafe-management-system


Compile the program:

gcc cafe.c -o cafe


Run the executable:

./cafe

📸 Sample Output
